		<p class= "content">With the exponential proliferation of information technology in first-world countries during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, hundreds of millions of people now have access to vast amounts of online data.</p>
		<p class="content"> The internet is a powerful tool that is taken for granted by many people in Canada; it is used frequently for social networking, emails, casual and academic research, and shopping (to name a few). But while Canadians enjoy the benefits of technology that has greatly raised our living standards, billions of people in far-away countries have no such privilege.</p> 
		<p class="content" id="bp">Africa, South and Central America, the Middle-East, Central and South-Asia and the Pacific are traditionally underdeveloped when it comes to the field of information-technology. Basic infrastructure such as computers and even internet connections are not available in many communities; as a result, well over half the world&#8217s population has no computer literacy skills and is cut off from a huge amount of information.</p>

	<div>
		<p class="content">At the Waterloo Technology Foundation, we are committed to reversing this trend by supporting worthy non-profit organizations working to integrate technology into developing communities on a grassroots level. Every person in the world, no matter who they are and where they are from, deserves the opportunity to use and benefit from technological resources.</p>
		<p class="content">The foundation, purely and online resource, serves to connect Canadians with worthy organizations from around the world working hard to bring information technology to developing regions (please see a list below). We gratefully accept donations of any amount, which are routed directly to our partner organizations for use in their projects. Contacting/making a donation directly to our partners is also encouraged.</p> 
		<p class="content">Through our partners, the foundation&#8217s goal is to target three main criteria that are central to community development.</p>
